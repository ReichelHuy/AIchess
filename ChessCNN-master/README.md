# ChessCNN  

This is a simple convolutional neural network trained on a [dataset I found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/niteshfre/chessman-image-dataset).  The test set I put together using images found online.  

There are images of different train/validation set performances in the Performance directory.
